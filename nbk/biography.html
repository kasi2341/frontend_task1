<h2 id="#family">Early life and family</h2>
<p>Nandamuri Balakrishna was born on 10 June 1960 in a Telugu family to Indian matinee idol and three-time chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N. T. Rama Rao and his wife Basavatarakam, in Madras (present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu).[19][20] As the Telugu film industry was based in Madras at that time, he spent his entire childhood in Madras. During his adolescence, he moved to Hyderabad following the shift of the Telugu film industry to that city.[citation needed] He earned a bachelor's degree in commerce from Nizam College, Hyderabad.[21][when?]

In 1982, at the age of 22, Balakrishna married Vasundhara Devi. They have three children</p>

    <h2 id="politician">Political career</h2>
    <p>Since the founding of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982, Balakrishna campaigned for it in every election for Rama Rao and Chandrababu Naidu, but did not enter the electoral battle until 2014. During a vacation to his father-in-law's house, he went on a political campaign for TDP all over the East Godavari district. He contested in the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election and won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency seat with a reasonable majority. He also won again in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, consecutively.[48] Hindupur, in Anantapur district, has been a stronghold for TDP since the formation of the party in 1983. It was once represented by his father and later for a term by his elder brother, Nandamuri Harikrishna. Balakrishna is the third member from the family to represent it in the State Assembly.[49]</p>
    <h2 id="Controversy">Controversy</h2>
    <p>Balakrishna was involved in a shootout controversy which took place on 3 June 2004 around 8:50 PM at his residence in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. He allegedly fired shots at producer Bellamkonda Suresh and his associate, Satyanarayana Chowdhary. Later, both the wounded were admitted into Apollo hospital.[50] The circumstances under which the case was handled led to controversy as purported by the Human Rights Forum (HRF). The HRF questioned the authenticity of people who handled the case, and the circumstances under which Balakrishna was shielded from police by being given refuge in Care Hospital without any justifiable cause.[51]

The two victims gave statements before the magistrate, alleging that Balakrishna fired shots at them, but later retracted their earlier statements.[52] Balakrishna was later arrested on 6 June and produced before Fifth Metropolitan Magistrate. A show cause notice was also served to Balakrishna's wife Vasundhara Devi as the weapon used was registered to her, and she could not give sufficient protection to her weapon. Later, Balakrishna was granted bail on the conditions that he should not leave Hyderabad without the court's permission and to surrender his passport.[53][54]</p>
